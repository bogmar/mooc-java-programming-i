primitive variable's information is stored as the value of that variable
reference variable holds a reference to information related to that variable
reference variables are practically always objects in Java
Java has eight different primitive variables: boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, double
All of the variables provided by Java (other than the eight primitive variables mentioned above) are reference type. A programmer is also free to create their own variable types by defining new classes. In practice, any object instanced from a class is a reference variable.
new - calling the class' constructor
Unlike when calling a method, we refer to a field of an object, so the parentheses that indicate a method call are not written.
