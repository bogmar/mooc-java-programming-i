array - masiv
string - niz
ArrayList<Integer>; ArrayList<Double>;
Variables in Java can be divided into two categories: value type (primitive) and reference type (reference type) variables
String line : lines (iterator za String Lines) - also known as for-each loop!
import java.util.ArrayList;
list.size()
If the parameter given to remove is the same type as the values in the list, but not an integer, (integers are used to remove from a given index), it can be used to remove a value directly from the list. aka list.remove("First");
list.remove(Integer.valueOf(15));
public static void print(ArrayList<String> list)
arraylist.contains
array.length (not array[].length() )
exercise Index was not found at arrays solution vs mine
int in java is 32 bits. one bit is reserved for the sign
array is an object so changing it inside a method is persistant
