the CLASS defines attributes of the objects (instance variables) + methods
the VALUES of the variables define it's internal state
the METHODS define what the object does
new keyword = constructor
instance variables = object fields or object attributes
a counstructor is added after the instance variables
the value of any object references will be null, meaning that they do not point to anything, and the values of primitives will be 0
the static modifier indicates that the method does not belong to an object and thus cannot be used to access any variables that belong to objects.
If a method receives as parameters all the variables whose values ​​it uses, it can have a static modifier.

toString method always ==    System.out.println(pekka); // same as System.out.println(pekka.toString());
the keyword final means that the value of the variable cannot be modified
persons.add(new Person(name));
string.isEmpty();
